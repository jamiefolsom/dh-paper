In case it's not clear, this is an attempt at Digital Humanities humor.

That said, it's a fun little project, and possibly a gentle introduction to a few useful tools, like [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com "A static site generator"), [Github](github.com) (let's work on this together!) and an invitation to collaborate across disciplines and domains, from coding to internationalization (let's translate this into French, German, Spanish, etc!), to linguistic computing (building noun phrases in from word lists in javascript).

Fork the repo, submit pull requests, and most of all, [submit issues](https://github.com/jamiefolsom/dh-paper/issues "Report bugs/send ideas!"), if you can offer improvements!
